Reviewing SwiftUI: using basic tools

## Why

I am reviewing SwiftUI and iOS development in general.

## What

Simple App inspired by a lesson by [Paul Hudson @ Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/wesplit-introduction) seen a while ago.
The App allows the user and their friends to check how much each of them have to pay to business, given the total and including a tip choice.

## How

- Used basic SwiftUI tools:
  - Pickers (two different styles)
  - Text
  - TextField
  
## Tech used

- SwiftUI
- Locale for using the correct currency symbol
- Keyboard with decimal pad
- amountIsFocused to make the keyboard disappear
- computed property to return a computation that has been converted to String and then formatted to show 2 decimals

## TODO

- Styling is basic as I was mainly interested in reviewing concepts.
